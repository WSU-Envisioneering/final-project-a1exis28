  <main>
    <p>I really loved this course. I learned so much about code. At first, I didn't even think I would 
      enjoy coding at all, but once I started, I felt like I couldn't stop. I think my favorite assignment 
      was the table and forms one because I love my CSS in that one. I also liked the 06 grid assignment 
      because of how satisfying it is to see the layout change from the size of your screen.
      HTML, CSS, and Python are all super fun to do; I wish I could choose a favorite.
    </p>

    <p>I learned how to do HTML, CSS, and Python. From HTML, I learned how to organize my code better, 
      make tables, forms, paragraphs, links, headers, and sections to organize my data. From CSS, I learned 
      how to color backgrounds, texts, footers, headers, and much more. I learned how to make layouts and
      have them adjust to the users screen. I learned how to do so much with borders, flexbox, CSS grid, 
      transitions, and so much more that I could go on forever. Finally, from Python I learned
      about inputs, variables, loops, and breaks. I love my game I created on Python!
